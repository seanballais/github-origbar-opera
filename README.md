### Why not just use the Chrome extension?
I did consider using the Chrome extension since Opera can use Chrome extensions nowadays. However, I want to turn this into a personal challenge. Should there be any issues using the Chrome extension that only occurs in Opera, I can immediately fix it without having to worry about potentially messing the code in the Chrome extension.

TL;DR: I made this "port" (?) as a personal challenge and exploration, and a way to fix any Opera-related issues that might arise while using the Chrome extension.
